I am currently participating in a Skills Bootcamp in Virtual Production, with a specific focus on
training with Sony’s high-end VENICE 2 cameras. It is providing me with a broad understanding
of virtual production (VP), learning how to seamlessly combine virtual computer-generated
imagery with live-action footage, gaining hands-on experience in the entire VP pipeline—from
Unreal Engine and camera tracking to plate playback and real-time content—greatly enhancing
my technical filmmaking skills.

Throughout the course, I am working with Sony VENICE 2 cameras, mastering their capabilities,
and refining my technical knowledge. This immersive experience is expanding my creative
toolkit and deepening my passion for innovative production techniques, aligning my skills with
the future of filmmaking. I am excited to apply the expertise I am gaining to contribute to high-
quality and technically advanced productions.
