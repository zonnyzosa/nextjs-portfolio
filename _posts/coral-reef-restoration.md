I am currently undertaking a Master’s by Research at the University of Bristol, supervised by renowned marine ecologist Professor Steve Simpson. Our research centers on innovative methods of coral reef restoration, particularly focusing on the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) as a tool to actively rebuild and support coral populations. This project aligns with my passion for marine conservation and leverages advanced scientific techniques to address the threats posed by climate change and human activities on coral ecosystems.

Our goal is to understand how IVF can enhance coral spawning success rates and promote resilience in vulnerable reef systems, with field studies based in the rich coral habitats of Egypt. This research combines cutting-edge science with real-world application, reflecting my dedication to developing sustainable solutions for marine life preservation.
