Through INCITE, I aim to spark curiosity and empower readers to explore the natural world from a fresh perspective. This project combines my background in zoology, filmmaking, and content creation to bring stories of biodiversity, environmental science, and conservation to life.


By blending captivating visuals with in-depth, well-researched content, INCITE will provide a platform for both scientists and enthusiasts to connect over the latest discoveries, pressing environmental challenges, and groundbreaking solutions. With topics ranging from coral reef restoration to urban wildlife, my goal is to inspire a deeper appreciation and understanding of science, bridging the gap between research and the everyday reader.
